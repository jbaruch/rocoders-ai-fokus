# Vibecoding Demo: RGBW Control App Requirements

This specification outlines a practical and impressive application for a 1-hour Vibecoding conference demo using agentic AI IDEs. The app controls a Shelly Duo GU10 RGBW smart bulb based on real-time color extraction from a webcam feed.

---

## Project Goal

Build a **web app that uses your webcam to detect dominant color and control a Shelly Duo GU10 RGBW bulb** over the local network.

* No manual IP input ‚Äî uses mDNS-based **automatic device discovery**
* Toggle between **manual or automatic color updates**
* Entire app runs locally with no cloud dependency

---

## üîß Backend (Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21)

**Include:**

* Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.5 app
* REST endpoint: `POST /color` accepts RGB data from frontend
* Use `RestClient` to call `http://<bulb-ip>/color/0`
* mDNS-based **local device discovery** on startup or `/discover` endpoint
* Basic error handling (try/catch, timeouts)

**Skip:**

* Circuit breakers
* Connection pooling configuration
* WebSocket
* Health checks / Actuator / Prometheus
* Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, MQTT

---

## Frontend (HTML + JS)

**Include:**

* `getUserMedia` for webcam access
* Simple color extraction (e.g. Color Thief)
* Show color preview box
* Toggle switch: Manual / Auto
* Button: ‚ÄúSend to Bulb‚Äù (only enabled in manual mode)
* If Auto mode is enabled, send color every 3 seconds
* Call `/discover` on load to fetch Shelly bulb IP
* **UI optimized for large screen demos:** full-screen layout with large, clearly visible components (preview box, toggle, and buttons)

**Skip:**

* WebSockets
* K-means, OffscreenCanvas, Web Workers
* HSL, Kelvin, or complex color math
* Camera constraint configuration

---

## üí° Shelly Integration

* Use Shelly REST API at `/color/0`
* Example payload:

  ```json
  { "red": 120, "green": 80, "blue": 200, "gain": 100 }
  ```
* Calculate white as `min(R,G,B)` to reduce color saturation
* Skip `/white/0`, `/light/0`, and advanced features

## Live Demo Flow

1. User opens the web app ‚Üí webcam activates
2. Shelly bulb is discovered automatically
3. Color is shown live on screen
4. User toggles between auto and manual mode
5. Bulb updates based on detected color
