# Vibecoding Demo: RGBW Control App Requirements

This specification outlines a practical and impressive application for a 1-hour Vibecoding conference demo using agentic AI IDEs. The app controls a Shelly Duo GU10 RGBW smart bulb based on real-time color extraction from a webcam feed.

**Include:**

* Simple color extraction (e.g. Color Thief)
* Show color preview box
* Input field for entering the Shelly bulb IP address manually
* Toggle switch: Manual / Auto
* Button: "Send to Bulb" (only enabled in manual mode)
* If Auto mode is enabled, send color every 3 seconds
* Camera Selection: Dropdown to select from available cameras (`navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`)
* **UI optimized for large screen demos:** full-screen layout with large, clearly visible components (preview box, toggle, and buttons)

## Project Goal

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project **intentionally opts in for simplicity** to enable a live agentic coding demo. All complexity (cloud sync, discovery, error resilience, persistence) is excluded by design to highlight agent productivity and focus.

Build a **web app that uses your webcam to detect dominant color and control a Shelly Duo GU10 RGBW bulb** over the local network.

* IP address of the bulb is entered manually in the UI
* Toggle between **manual or automatic color updates**
* Entire app runs locally with no cloud dependency

## üîß Backend (Spring Boot 3.5, Java 21)

**Include:**

* Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.5 app
* REST endpoint: `POST /color` accepts RGB data from frontend
* Use `RestClient` to call `http://<bulb-ip>/light/0`
* Basic error handling (try/catch, timeouts)

**Skip:**

* Circuit breakers
* Connection pooling configuration
* WebSocket
* Health checks / Actuator / Prometheus
* Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, MQTT

**Discovery Implementation Notes:**

* Use JmDNS after researching it with context7
* Important: Java mDNS must bind to correct network interface (not loopback 127.0.0.1). Auto-select non-loopback, site-local interface for JmDNS binding

---

## Frontend (HTML + JS)

**Include:**

* `getUserMedia` for webcam access
* Simple color extraction (e.g. Color Thief)
* Show color preview box
* Input field for entering the Shelly bulb IP address manually
* Toggle switch: Manual / Auto
* Button: ‚ÄúSend to Bulb‚Äù (only enabled in manual mode)
* If Auto mode is enabled, send color every 3 seconds
* **UI optimized for large screen demos:** full-screen layout with large, clearly visible components (preview box, toggle, and buttons)

**Skip:**

* WebSockets
* K-means, OffscreenCanvas, Web Workers
* HSL, Kelvin, or complex color math
* Camera constraint configuration beyond device selection

---

## üí° Shelly Integration

* Use Shelly REST API at `/light/0`
* Supported query parameters:

  * `turn=on`
  * `red`, `green`, `blue`, `white` (0..255)
  * `gain=100`
* Example URL format:

  ```
  http://192.168.1.42/light/0?turn=on&red=120&green=80&blue=200&white=40&gain=100
  ```
* Calculate white as `min(R,G,B)` to reduce color saturation
* Skip `/white/0`, `/color/0`, and advanced features

## Live Demo Flow

1. User opens the web app ‚Üí webcam activates
2. User enters IP address of the Shelly bulb
3. Color is shown live on screen
4. User toggles between auto and manual mode
5. Bulb updates based on detected color
